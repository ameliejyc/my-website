  <li><a class="cv__link" href="http://warppublishing.net">Warp Publishing</a>, 2015-2017 - Copyright Manager
  <p>Music publishers can be thought of as record labels for songwriters. At Warp Publishing (sister company of Warp Records) I looked after the compositional rights of writers' works and ensured that they were registered correctly globally at collection societies and digital platforms such as YouTube. This involved resolving counter and duplicate claims, tracking and analysing global income and fixing discrepancies at collection societies, digital service providers and sub-publishers to ensure our writers got full royalty payments.
